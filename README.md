# Duplicate-Question-Detector
The Duplicate Question Detector is a machine learning/NLP-based project designed to identify semantically similar or duplicate questions. This tool is particularly useful for platforms like Q&amp;A forums, customer support systems, and knowledge bases where repeated or slightly rephrased questions can clutter the system and affect user experience.
